# Hi there, I'm Mo Yusif 👋

### The Hybrid Expert: AI Engineering + Sales Psychology
I build Agentic AI systems that don't just run—they close deals. With 20+ years of high-stakes business development in the GCC combined with cutting-edge AI engineering, I bridge the gap between technical possibility and business reality.
